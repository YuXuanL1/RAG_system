# RAG_system

## Introduction
This project is Comprehensive RAG competition hosted by META on the [AIcrowd website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/meta-comprehensive-rag-benchmark-kdd-cup-2024/problems/meta-kdd-cup-24-crag-retrieval-summarization). There are three task in this competition, but we only focus on task 1. In this task, we are provided with up to five web pages for each question. While these web pages are likely, but not guaranteed, to be relevant. The objective of this task is to evaluate the answer generation capabilities of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Tasks
- Analyze the provided web pages and remove irrelevant content.
- Implement at least one of the following retrieval models:
  - Vector Space Model (VSM)
  - Language Model (LM)
- Combining predictions from multiple models, such as TF-IDF, BM25, or JM-smoothing. 
- Use LLM to generate answers based on the retrieved information.
- Adopt machine learning toolkits to create a classifier that judges whether the retrieved information is relevant to the query.
- Experiment with different LLMs and settings, such as quantization to optimize performance and efficiency.
- Fine-tune the LLM on relevant datasets to further enhance its accuracy and adaptability for this specific task.
